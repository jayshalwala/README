Cybersecurity Professional Summary 

# 👋 Hi, I'm Jay Shalwala

🎯 **Aspiring Cybersecurity Analyst** | 🛡️ Security Operations | 🔍 Threat Detection & Response  
📍 Based in Vancouver, BC | ✉️ shalwalajay@gmail.com

---

I'm a junior cybersecurity professional actively building hands-on experience through the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and real-world simulations. My strengths include Linux security, network traffic analysis, vulnerability assessment, and incident response.

I enjoy translating complex security scenarios into clear, actionable insights — and I'm driven to make systems safer through structured analysis, threat modeling, and continuous learning.
